# Work_Day_Scheduler
A work Day scheduler

## Description

This weekly challenge was to make a work day scheduler with the capability of saving to your local storage even after the page is refreshed.




## Installation
A source code was provided for this challenge. I used Day.js library to determine and display date and time on the website. I also used js to ensure the saved appointments are saved to a local storage so data won't be lost when the page is refreshed.
